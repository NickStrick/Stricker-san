        `I’m rooted in philosophy and lifelong learning, heavily influenced by Zen Buddhism, Alan Watts, and the kind of thinking that reminds you to slow down, breathe, and maybe stop overthinking everything for five minutes. I spend a lot of time in nature for the same reason, it’s honest, humbling, and wildly good at putting things back into perspective. I also admire Tony Robbins’ obsession with discipline, energy, and momentum… which explains a lot about my calendar and my caffeine intake.

I work in technology, cybersecurity, and AI, and I’m also a lifelong health hacker—constantly experimenting with habits, routines, and data to stay sharp, energized, and human in a world that doesn’t always encourage balance.

At the center of it all is love and family. They keep me grounded, patient, and real. Everything I do, teaching, mentoring, building, and learning, is an extension of that love. That’s the throughline of my work: philosophy as a compass, nature as a reset button, and service as the way forward.`,
